# IoT based Home Automation with & without Internet
Many IoT based Home Automation projects crashes when the Internet speed goes down. So, within this project I tried to built such an IoT prototype which can automate the Home not only when Internet speed is good but also when Internet speed goes down. In this project Iâ€™m going to use OSH NodeMCU V1.0 ESP8266 Development Board and Bluetooth HC-05 Module for communication &amp; control 4 electrical loads connected to NodeMCU with Blynk Android App &amp; my custom-made Bluetooth Automation App. Blynk App can be used when Internet speed is good on both side &amp; Bluetooth Automation App can be used when the you are near the project &amp; not have internet at all.
